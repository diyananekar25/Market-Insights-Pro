The high price point of vertical slow juicers compared to centrifugal models may limit accessibility for some consumers. However, the increasing availability of affordable, entry-level options is expected to mitigate this issue.</p><p>Key drivers of this growth include:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Customization and Versatility:</strong> New models will offer consumers the ability to juice a wider range of fruits, vegetables, and leafy greens with minimal effort.</li>  <li><strong>Health and Wellness Culture:</strong> The demand for fresh, nutrient-dense beverages will remain strong as more people turn to plant-based and clean eating lifestyles.</li>  <li><strong>Social Media Influence:</strong> Platforms like Instagram and TikTok, with their wellness influencers, will continue to drive interest in juicing.</li></ul><h2>Market Competition and Future Outlook</h2><p>The market will also witness increased competition.
